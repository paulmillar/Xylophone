  Xylophone: style-sheets for expressing XML as LDIF.

The project page is available here:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/xylophone


Documentation is available within the file: Documentation/Guide.txt.
This file describes how to use Xylophone and gives several examples.

A complete, but trivial "hello world" example is provided with the
file hello-world.xml.  To use it (with xsltproc), do:

  xsltproc xsl/xylophone.xsl Documentation/hello-world.xml

The file Documentation/dynamic.xml is an example "dynamic" file that
is mentioned in the documentation.  It is included for convenience and
is not required to use Xylophone.

The XSLT style-sheets are made available under the terms and
conditions described in the file Licence.txt and at the top of each
XSLT file.  In essence, it is a three-clause BSD license.
